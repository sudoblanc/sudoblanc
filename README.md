### Hi there 👋

### About Me
As the tech industry progresses thorugh a lot of changes such as AI integrations, New services, Cloud , infrastructure, network. These become too much for a development team to handle, I work at the heart of FedEx's Information Technology Change funnel, as an intern thats progressing to work as a project management analyst, I hold skills that are necessary to assess impacts on organizational level. I help the organzation as a part of team that analyzes these changes and closely works with solution architects, and Solution engineers.

Outside of my work life, keeping myself busy with a thought that I have embraced over time, "Learning never stops and should never stop" is what I walk with. I believe in continuous learning and get myself involved with projects that I love to do. These projects doesn't just reamin under the same unbrella as what I do at work but rather follow a path of personal journey which helps me to reflect and learn. Security, Cloud and Networking has always been the three pillars that stand tall when it comes to my interests but recently AI and Automation is something that I have enjoyed working with.

What drives me to be here? Most of the results out of my curiosity and efforts to learn has been on backend and undocumented. I believe these curiosity could be shared among passionate individuals .
